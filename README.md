## 📖 1. Introduction  

This project demonstrates a **fully automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline** designed to overcome the challenges of **slow, manual, and error-prone software delivery**.  

Traditional deployment processes are time-consuming and hinder a team's ability to deliver updates quickly. By implementing **DevOps principles**, this pipeline automates the entire release process — from **code commit to production deployment** — ensuring faster, more reliable, and repeatable delivery.  

> 💡 *Inspired by the Global Professional Internship (GPI) Program problem statement*, focusing on efficient and scalable web application delivery for modern business needs.
