## 📖 1. Introduction

This project demonstrates a **fully automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline** for deploying a **To-Do List web application**.

The pipeline is designed to overcome the challenges of **manual, time-consuming, and error-prone software delivery** by automating every stage — from **code commit to production deployment**.

By applying **DevOps principles**, the project ensures faster, more reliable, and repeatable delivery for a simple yet functional To-Do List app that helps users create, update, and manage daily tasks efficiently.

> 💡 *Inspired by the Global Professional Internship (GPI) Program problem statement*, focusing on efficient and scalable web application delivery for modern business needs.

## 🎯 2. Project Objectives

The main goal is to **build an end-to-end DevOps pipeline** that automates the deployment of a To-Do List app, improving productivity and reliability.

**Key objectives include:**
- ⚙️ Implement a **DevOps-driven CI/CD pipeline** for automated deployment.  
- ⚡ Reduce deployment time and remove manual steps.  
- 🧩 Ensure application consistency through containerization.  
- 💡 Enable developers to focus on building new features instead of deployment issues.

## 🧰 3. Technology Stack

| **Component** | **Technology** | **Purpose** |
|----------------|----------------|--------------|
| Version Control | **Git & GitHub** | Source code management and collaboration |
| CI/CD Automation | **Jenkins / GitHub Actions** | Automate build, test, and deploy workflows |
| Containerization | **Docker** | Package the To-Do List app into lightweight containers |
| Container Registry | **Docker Hub** | Store and distribute Docker images |
| Cloud / Server | **AWS EC2 / Local VM** | Host and deploy the containerized app |
| Sample App | **Node.js (Express)** or **Python (Flask)** | To-Do List web application |

## 🏗️ 4. Pipeline Architecture & Workflow

### 🔁 High-Level Architecture

+--------------+ +--------------+ +------------------+ +--------------+ +---------------------+
| Developer | --> | GitHub Repo | --> | CI Server | --> | Docker Hub | --> | Production Server |
| (git push) | | (Webhook) | | (Build & Test) | | (Image Store)| | (App Deployment) |
+--------------+ +--------------+ +------------------+ +--------------+ +---------------------+


---

### ⚙️ Step-by-Step Flow

1. **Code Commit** → Developer pushes new features or updates of the To-Do List app to the `main` branch.  
2. **Trigger Pipeline** → GitHub webhook triggers Jenkins or GitHub Actions workflow.  
3. **Build & Test (CI)** → The CI server pulls the latest code, builds the app, and runs automated tests.  
4. **Containerize** → Docker packages the To-Do List app into a container image.  
5. **Push to Registry** → The Docker image is tagged and pushed to **Docker Hub**.  
6. **Deploy (CD)** → The production server automatically pulls the latest image and restarts the container with **zero downtime**.  
7. **Notify** → Build and deployment notifications are sent via Slack or email.

## 🧩 6. To-Do List Application Overview

The **To-Do List App** is a simple full-stack web application that allows users to:
- ➕ Add new tasks  
- ✅ Mark tasks as complete  
- 🗑️ Delete tasks  
- ✏️ Edit existing tasks  

This app serves as a **practical example** for demonstrating CI/CD automation, containerization, and deployment in real-world environments.

---

## 🧪 7. Results & Benefits

✅ Fully automated CI/CD pipeline from commit → deployment  
✅ Reduced deployment time and manual effort  
✅ Consistent and repeatable builds using Docker  
✅ Scalable deployment using AWS EC2 or local environments  
✅ Improved developer productivity and focus on innovation
