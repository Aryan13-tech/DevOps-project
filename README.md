🚀 Automated CI/CD Pipeline for Web Application Deployment 🚀
A modern, end-to-end DevOps solution to build, test, and deploy a full-stack web application automatically using GitHub Actions, Docker, and AWS.

</div>

✨ Project Overview
This project demonstrates a robust, production-ready CI/CD pipeline that automates the entire software delivery lifecycle. Inspired by the challenges of manual deployments, this solution replaces slow, error-prone processes with a fast, reliable, and "hands-off" system. The pipeline automatically deploys a dynamic To-Do List web application built with Node.js.

The Goal: Move from slow, manual deployments to a rapid, automated, one-click release process.

🎯 Key Features & Accomplishments
✅ Zero-Touch Deployment: The entire process, from git push to a live production update, is 100% automated.

✅ Drastic Time Reduction: Deployment time is cut from hours to under 15 minutes.

✅ Infrastructure as Code: The entire pipeline is defined in a version-controlled YAML file (main.yml), making it transparent, repeatable, and easy to modify.

✅ Robust Artifact Management: Uses AWS S3 for secure, versioned storage of every build artifact, allowing for easy rollbacks.

✅ Containerized Environment: Leverages Docker to ensure the application runs consistently across development, testing, and production environments.

✅ Cloud-Native Deployment: Deploys the application to a scalable and reliable AWS EC2 instance.

⚙️ The Automated Workflow in Action
📥 Commit: A developer pushes code to the main branch on GitHub.

🚀 Trigger: A GitHub Actions workflow is automatically triggered.

🔬 Build & Test: The pipeline checks out the code, installs dependencies (npm install), and runs automated tests.

📦 Package & Store: Upon success, the application is packaged into a .zip artifact and uploaded to an AWS S3 bucket.

☁️ Deploy: The pipeline securely connects to the AWS EC2 server, pulls the artifact from S3, builds a new Docker image, and restarts the application container with zero downtime.

🛠️ Getting Started
To replicate this project, you will need the following prerequisites:

Git installed locally

A GitHub account

An AWS account with permissions for EC2, S3, and IAM

Docker installed on your local machine for testing

Setup Instructions:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name

AWS Infrastructure Setup:

Create an AWS S3 bucket.

Launch an AWS EC2 instance (Ubuntu LTS is recommended).

Configure Security Groups to allow inbound SSH (port 22) and your app's port (e.g., 3000 or 80).

Install Docker on the EC2 instance.

GitHub Secrets Configuration: In your GitHub repository settings (Settings > Secrets and variables > Actions), create the following secrets:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your AWS Access Key.

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your AWS Secret Access Key.

EC2_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: The SSH private key to access your EC2 instance.

EC2_HOST: The public IP or DNS of your AWS EC2 instance.

EC2_USER: The username for your EC2 instance (e.g., ubuntu).

S3_BUCKET_NAME: The name of your AWS S3 bucket.

Trigger the Pipeline:

Commit and push a change to the main branch:

git add .
git commit -m "feat: Ready to trigger the CI/CD pipeline!"
git push origin main

Monitor & Verify:

Navigate to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to watch the pipeline run in real-time.

Once successful, access your deployed application using the public IP of your EC2 instance!
