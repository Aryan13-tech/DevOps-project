üöÄ Automated CI/CD Pipeline for To-Do List Web Application Deployment
üìñ 1. Introduction
This project demonstrates a fully automated Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline designed to overcome the challenges of slow, manual, and error-prone software delivery. It focuses on deploying a dynamic To-Do List web application as the demonstration payload.

Traditional deployment processes are time-consuming and hinder a team's ability to deliver updates quickly. By implementing DevOps principles, this pipeline automates the entire release process ‚Äî from code commit to production deployment ‚Äî ensuring faster, more reliable, and repeatable delivery.

üí° Inspired by the Global Professional Internship (GPI) Program problem statement, this project focuses on building an efficient and scalable web application delivery system using modern cloud-native practices.

üéØ 2. Project Objectives
The main goal is to build an end-to-end DevOps solution that automates the deployment of a web application and significantly improves developer productivity and release reliability.

Key objectives include:

‚öôÔ∏è Implement a DevOps-driven CI/CD pipeline for smooth web application deployment.

‚ö° Reduce deployment time from hours to minutes and eliminate manual intervention.

üì¶ Deliver updates and new features more reliably and consistently.

üí° Allow teams to focus on innovation instead of repetitive deployment tasks.

‚úÖ Utilize AWS cloud services (EC2, S3) for robust infrastructure and artifact management.

üß∞ 3. Technology Stack

    G -- Download Artifact --> E;
    E -- Artifact Pulled --> G;
    G -- Build & Run Docker --> H(Running Application);
    H -- User Access --> I[End User];

‚öôÔ∏è Step-by-Step Flow
Code Commit ‚Üí A developer pushes code changes to the main branch of the GitHub repository.

Trigger Pipeline ‚Üí A GitHub webhook automatically triggers the GitHub Actions CI/CD workflow.

Build & Test (CI) ‚Üí The GitHub Actions runner pulls the latest code, installs Node.js dependencies, builds the application, and runs automated tests.

Artifact Creation & Storage ‚Üí Upon successful build and tests, the application is packaged into a versioned build artifact (e.g., a .zip file). This artifact is then uploaded and securely stored in a designated AWS S3 bucket.

Deploy (CD) ‚Üí GitHub Actions securely connects to the production AWS EC2 instance via SSH.

Pull Artifact & Deploy ‚Üí On the EC2 instance, a deployment script:

Downloads the latest build artifact from the AWS S3 bucket.

Uses the artifact and the Dockerfile to build a fresh Docker image locally.

Stops the old container, removes it, and starts a new Docker container with the newly built image, ensuring a seamless update.

Notify ‚Üí Build and deployment notifications can be configured to be sent (e.g., via GitHub Actions logs, or integrated with Slack/email).

üõ†Ô∏è 6. Getting Started
To set up and run this project, you will need the following prerequisites:

Git installed locally

A GitHub account

An AWS account with permissions for EC2, S3, and IAM (to create necessary roles/users)

Docker installed on your local machine (for local testing of the Dockerfile)

Basic knowledge of Node.js/Express, Docker, Git, and AWS CLI.

Setup Instructions:

Clone the repository:

git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name

AWS Infrastructure Setup:

Create an AWS S3 bucket for storing build artifacts.

Launch an AWS EC2 instance (e.g., Ubuntu LTS).

Configure Security Groups to allow inbound SSH (port 22) and HTTP/HTTPS (ports 80/443 or your app port).

Install Docker on the EC2 instance.

Create an IAM Role with S3 read/write permissions for the EC2 instance or configure AWS CLI with credentials.

GitHub Secrets Configuration: In your GitHub repository settings, create the following secrets:

AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID: Your AWS Access Key ID.

AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY: Your AWS Secret Access Key.

EC2_SSH_PRIVATE_KEY: The SSH private key to access your EC2 instance.

EC2_HOST: The public IP or DNS of your AWS EC2 instance.

EC2_USER: The username for your EC2 instance (e.g., ubuntu).

S3_BUCKET_NAME: The name of your AWS S3 bucket.

Application Development (To-Do List):

Develop the simple Node.js/Express To-Do List application within the app/ directory.

Ensure a Dockerfile is correctly defined for your application.

Write some basic automated tests for your application.

Configure GitHub Actions Workflow (.github/workflows/main.yml):

Update the main.yml file with the correct paths, commands, and AWS region.

Trigger the Pipeline:

Make a small change to the application code in the app/ directory.

Commit and push the changes to the main branch:

git add .
git commit -m "feat: Initial commit and CI/CD pipeline trigger"
git push origin main

Monitor & Verify:

Go to the "Actions" tab in your GitHub repository to monitor the pipeline's execution.

Once the pipeline is successful, access your deployed To-Do List application via the public IP of your AWS EC2 instance in a web browser.
